        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Rockso (“we”, “us”, “our”). We are committed to protecting your
          privacy and handling your personal data in a transparent and secure way.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store and share your
          information when you use the Rockso application and related services
          (the “Services”).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rockso</strong> is a multi-sport training assistant focused on
          training load management, fatigue and injury prevention, built for
          athletes, coaches and performance staff.

        <h2>2. Data we collect</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Data you provide</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>

        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Data collected automatically</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">

        <h3>2.3 Data from third-party services (optional)</h3>
        <p>
          When you connect Rockso to third-party services (for example
          training platforms or GPS watches), we may receive:
        </p>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>activity details (sport, date, duration, distance, elevation);</li>
          <li>physiological data (heart rate, power, cadence, etc.);</li>
          <li>
            where applicable, recovery-related indicators (sleep, recent load,
            recovery scores, etc.).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We only access this data if you explicitly authorise it, and only to
          provide the features you choose to use.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-block">
        <h2>3. How we use your data</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Main purposes</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>
            <strong>Providing the Services</strong>:
            creating and managing your account, displaying your training
            data and dashboards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Training load and progression analysis</strong>:
            computing load indicators, highlighting trends, identifying
            sensitive periods (overload, underload, return to training).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personalised recommendations</strong>:
            suggesting adjustments (e.g. lighten, stabilise or increase load,
            propose cross-training).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Injury risk reduction</strong>:
            helping to identify patterns of overload or insufficient recovery
            to protect your health in the long term.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Secondary purposes</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>
            <strong>Product improvement</strong>:
            understanding how the Service is used in order to improve
            features and user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support &amp; communication</strong>:
            responding to your requests, organising pilot projects,
            discussing your needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security</strong>:
            detecting fraud or abuse and protecting our infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal compliance</strong>:
            meeting applicable legal and regulatory obligations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 AI and machine learning</h3>
        <p>
          Rockso uses AI and machine learning techniques to:
        </p>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>analyse training history and load patterns;</li>
          <li>identify overload or lack of recovery;</li>
          <li>
            propose adjustments (e.g. reducing a session, suggesting
            an easier day, adapting a return-to-training week).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When we use data to improve our models, we favour
          <strong>aggregated and anonymised</strong> forms whenever possible.
          For any more advanced use (e.g. research project),
          we will ask for your <strong>explicit consent</strong>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section-block">
        <h2>4. How we share your data</h2>

        <h3>4.1 With your consent</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>
            <strong>Coach / staff access</strong>:
            if you connect your account to a coach, physical trainer or organisation,
            they may access the data you authorise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exports</strong>:
            some features may allow you to export your data or summaries to other
            platforms, only when you trigger it yourself.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Service providers</h3>
        <p>
          We use trusted service providers to operate the Services, for example:
        </p>
        <ul class="checklist">
          <li>
            <strong>Hosting &amp; database</strong>:
            Supabase (hosting and storage, in the EU when possible).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI services</strong>:
            providers of AI models (for example open-source models such as those
            provided by Mistral) for certain analysis or recommendation features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication tools</strong>:
            e-mail or support tools to send notifications and manage requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment provider (if applicable)</strong>:
            if you subscribe to a paid plan, we may rely on a third-party payment
            provider to process transactions. Rockso does not store your card details.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These providers act on the basis of contracts that restrict their
          use of data and require compliance with applicable regulations
          (including GDPR where relevant).
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Legal requirements</h3>
        <p>
          We may disclose certain data in response to a legal obligation or
          valid request from a competent authority (for example a court order).
        </p>

        <h3>4.4 Business transfers</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of a merger, acquisition or transfer of activity, your data
          may be transferred to the new entity, in compliance with applicable law.
          You will be informed beforehand where required.

        <p>
          At this stage, Rockso does not use advertising cookies or trackers
