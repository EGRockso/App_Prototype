              Rockso analyses how your sessions chain together (intensity, volume, frequency)
              alongside day-to-day stress, and highlights sensitive periods where adjusting
              training becomes critical.

              endurance sports, team sports, racket sports and winter sports into a single
              view – even when traditional platforms keep them separate.

              simple decisions: increase, stabilise or decrease load, switch to
              cross-training, adapt a key week to your real-life context.
